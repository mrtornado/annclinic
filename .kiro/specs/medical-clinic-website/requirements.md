# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves building a modern, SEO-optimized medical clinic website for ANN Clinic, similar to annclinic.ro but with enhanced functionality and additional landing pages for improved search engine rankings and Google AdWords campaigns. The website will serve as the primary digital presence for a multi-specialty medical clinic located in Bragadiru (near Bucharest), offering comprehensive medical services across 14+ specialties including cardiology, dermatology, gynecology, pediatrics, and aesthetic treatments.

The website must be built using a hybrid Astro + React architecture where **Astro serves as an SEO-optimized shell** and **React handles all interactivity**. This approach combines Astro's superior SEO performance with React's rich interactive capabilities, using Tailwind CSS 4 and Magic UI components for modern animations and user experience. All content, pages, and user interface elements must be in Romanian language to serve the local Romanian market effectively.

## Architecture Requirements

### Astro as SEO Shell

- Astro generates static HTML for maximum SEO performance
- Content Collections manage medical articles, services, and doctor profiles
- Zero JavaScript by default, selective hydration for interactive components
- BaseLayout provides consistent Header/Footer structure across all pages

### React for Interactivity

- All interactive components (buttons, cards, animations) use React with Framer Motion
- Page sections organized as React components (`/components/home/`)
- Magic UI component library for advanced animations and micro-interactions
- State management and dynamic behavior handled entirely in React
